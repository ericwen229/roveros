# RoverOS

RoverOS is a server application implemented in Java,
with which one can navigate a Turtlebot in a given map
with the help of a client. Also, it implements a set
of APIs that wraps up the ROSJava API and allows programmers
to publish on or subscribe to topics easily without having
to care about starting or shutting down nodes.
